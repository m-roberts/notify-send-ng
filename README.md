# 'Next generation' `notify-send` (`notify-send-ng`)

This package provides a drop-in replacement for [`libnotify`](https://packages.debian.org/source/stable/libnotify)'s `notify-send` command.

Based on [vlevit's `notify-send.sh`](https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh), `notify-send-ng` also allows for sending notifications without requiring it to be run by the same user or needing to know which display is currently active.
